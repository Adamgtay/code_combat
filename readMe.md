# Code Combat

**ASCII Arcade Shooter Built with Pygame (Space-Invaders Inspired)**

**Language:** Python  
**Technologies:** Pygame, ASCII rendering, Game Loop Logic  

---

## Description

Code Combat is a Space-Invaders–inspired arcade shooter built using **Python and Pygame**, where all visuals are created using **custom ASCII graphics** rather than traditional sprites.

The project combines **game logic, creative design, and playful experimentation**, using text characters as a visual language while still benefiting from Pygame’s event handling, timing, and structure.

---

## Creative Approach

All game visuals were intentionally designed in ASCII:

- The player controls a **battle tank** drawn entirely with characters  
- Enemies are **bug-shaped**, a playful nod to programming “bugs”  
- Projectiles fire **random ASCII characters**, reinforcing the coding theme  
- Explosions are animated using ASCII-based sequences  

This approach treats text as a **creative medium**, not a limitation, and encourages learners to think visually even without sprites or images.

## Why ASCII with Pygame?

Using Pygame for an ASCII-rendered game serves both creative and educational goals:

- Separates **game mechanics from visual assets**
- Makes movement, collision, and state changes easy to reason about
- Demonstrates how visuals can be layered on top of solid logic
- Provides a stepping stone from CLI games to sprite-based Pygame projects  

---

## Features

- Real-time player movement and shooting  
- Enemy waves with increasing difficulty  
- Collision detection using grid-based logic  
- Score tracking and game states  
- Pygame-powered input handling and frame timing

## Learning Outcomes / Skills Demonstrated
- Creative use of Pygame beyond sprite-based graphics
- Designing and implementing a complete game loop
- Real-time input handling and state management
- Collision detection without traditional visual assets
- Combining technical systems with playful design choices

## Educational Value
Code Combat is well-suited for teaching young learners because it:
- Shows how games work internally, without hiding logic
- Encourages creativity even with technical constraints
- Makes abstract concepts like collision and state visible
- Acts as a bridge from text-based games to graphical ones
